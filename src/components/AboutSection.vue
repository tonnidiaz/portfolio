                        <p>I was introduced to coding 2 years ago through a module called Modelling at the University of Johannesburg.</p>
                        <p>At first I was annoyed by it since I did not have any coding background.</p>
                        <p>After a few weeks I finally understood the concept and my interest in coding started growing.</p>
                        <p>After I was able to write if-statements and for-loops I started becoming more confident and obsessed to a point where I stayed up all night practicing and watching tutorials.</p>
                        <p>About a year later I didn't care much about food or sleeping anymore. I just wanted to code!</p>

                            I build high performance web and mobile apps using
                            multiple powerfull technologies such as React, Vue,
                            Flutter, Ionic, e.t.c.
                        </p>
                        <p>My products are simplistic, responsive, and user friendly.</p>
                       <p>I'm usually doing both Front-end and Back-end work but I prefere the backend because I'm into functionality and how stuff works.</p>
